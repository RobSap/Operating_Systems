### Projects
These are two projects I did for projects in my underrgraduate operating systems class. These programs are written in C and use Linux system calls.

#### ATP 
Around the Pond is a program to allow users to let users publish and/or subscribe  to topics (articles) and allower users to read or post only what they want. It is responsive and scalable and simulates a "news" service or a "publisher" service.
Code [here](https://github.com/RobSap/Operating_Systems/tree/master/ATP)

#### MCP 
This is a simulated master control program. The goal is to write a program that will run and schedule workloads for programs on a system.
